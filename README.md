# servo-svg-plotter

#### Goal

> Plotting (SVG) vectorgraphics with a self designed robot. <br><br>
> Specifically bezier curves (which all outlines can be converted to) <br>
> using their curvature and vector decomposition <br>
> to spin two connected threaded shafts using servos accordingly
> and have a pen trace their combined movement
